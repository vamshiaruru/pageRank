Most people know the basics about the moon. It orbits our planet in a slight ellipse, just as our planet orbits the sun. The relationship between the Earth, the sun and the moon creates the moon's phases as well as solar and lunar eclipses. On clear nights, a full moon outshines many stars by reflecting light from the sun.
But the moon is more than just a pretty face. It contributes to the ocean's tides on Earth. Its presence also helps regulate the Earth's orbit. Space.com's article on moon mechanics explains many of the ways that the moon affects the Earth.

But how did it get here? There are four main theories:
In addition to its physical composition, the moon differs from Earth in other ways. It has substantially less gravity because it's so much less massive. For the same reason, it also has very little atmosphere -- its gravity isn't strong enough to hold an atmosphere to its surface.
