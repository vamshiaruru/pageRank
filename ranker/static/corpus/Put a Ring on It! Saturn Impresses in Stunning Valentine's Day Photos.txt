Put a Ring on It! Saturn Impresses in Stunning Valentine's Day Photos

	NASA's Cassini spacecraft sends its love this Valentine's Day with photos of Saturn's beautiful rings, moons and polar vortex.

	The Cassini-Huygens mission -- a joint collaboration led by NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency -- launched in 1997 and is in its final year in orbit around Saturn. Throughout its stay at the ringed planet, Cassini has captured extraordinary photos that are published in an image gallery online. Anyone can download the photos to create artistic masterpieces of their own.

	"We're so gratified that Cassini's images have inspired people to work with the pictures themselves to produce such beautiful creations," Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in a statement from NASA. [Valentine's Day in Space: Cosmic Love Photos]

This stunning view captures Saturn's tiny moon Enceladus, tucked within the planet's E ring. The photo is a composite of images taken by Cassini on July 19, 2013.

	Enceladus has a diameter of 314 miles (505 kilometers), and despite its freezing temperatures, scientists say the moon hosts liquid water beneath its surface and therefore has the potential to support life.

	Another amazing composite photo captures Saturn's largest moon, Titan, as a crescent with a distinct cyan-colored layer of haze in the moon's upper atmosphere. The images of Titan used in this composite were captured by Cassini on Jan. 2, 2014.
