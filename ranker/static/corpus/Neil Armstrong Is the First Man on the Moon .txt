Neil Armstrong Is the First Man on the Moon 
On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon and took their first steps on the lunar surface. Half a billion people around the world watched live television images that recorded the event. The landing was, without a doubt, one of the most significant achievements of modern civilization.
It is made even more remarkable by the fact that no human being had ever been in space before 1961. To go from "no human being in space" to "walking on the moon" in just eight years is startling. It happened because of a very intense learning process.

NASA was created in 1958, about a year after Russia's launch of the Sputnik satellite. President Kennedy announced the idea of the moon missions in his famous speech on May 25, 1961. In particular he said:
Even in this paragraph we see an emphasis on research, and if you read the whole speech you see it even more.
Think about everything that NASA had to learn. It needed to know how to:
The Mercury missions gave NASA experience in getting people into orbit and back. The Gemini missions dealt with things like docking, space suits and space walking. In the early Apollo missions, NASA learned about orbiting the moon and getting home. And then Apollo 11 was able to put everything together.
Even today it's hard to believe that it all worked, especially given the rather primitive technology available at Athe time. That makes the achievement one of the most amazing in human history.
