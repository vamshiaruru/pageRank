US National Parks Prepare for the 2017 Total Solar Eclipse



	The celestial event, sometimes called the Great American Total Solar Eclipse, is the first such eclipse to travel the width of the U.S. in nearly 100 years, offering a spectacular celestial show for millions of skywatchers. During the total solar eclipse on Aug. 21, the disk of the moon will move directly in front of the sun, briefly turning day into night. 

	It will take about 90 minutes for the moon's dark shadow to sweep across the country, starting around 10:15 a.m. PDT on the West Coast and ending around 2:45 p.m. EDT (11:45 a.m. PDT) on the East Coast. [21 National Parks Where You Can Enjoy the 2017 Solar Eclipse]

	The path of totality for the solar eclipse -- where people will experience the moon fully blot out the sun -- is about 70 miles (113 kilometers) wide and stretches from Oregon to South Carolina, encompassing 21 U.S. national parks or historical monuments and scenic trails. The national parks in the path of totality will experience darkness for different lengths of time, ranging from only a few seconds up to 2 minutes 40 seconds at most. Outside the path of totality, viewers in the continental U.S. and other nearby areas will see a partial solar eclipse. 

	With less than three months to go, the National Park Service (NPS) is getting ready to accommodate large crowds and helping to plan special viewing events or educational opportunities at most of the parks. Visitor safety is of top concern, as well as preservation of each park's natural resources. 

	Grand Teton National Park in northwestern Wyoming is preparing for what is expected to be "busiest day ever" in the history of the park. 

	"August is already our busiest time of year, but as a result of the eclipse we are expecting to be even more crowded than normal," Dan Greenblatt, Colter Bay District Interpreter at Grand Teton National Park, told Space.com. "Grand Teton National Park features a stunning mountain landscape, and I think that is one reason that people are coming here: To see the eclipse as it passes over the mountains," Greenblatt said, adding that the park generally has pretty good weather in August, too. 

	While planning viewing events, many of the parks consider their natural, historical or cultural significance, and how that may tie into the total solar eclipse, Sara Melena, NPS education specialist, told Space.com. 

	"People can go see [the eclipse] for 3,000 miles across the country, but there is a reason that they are coming to a national park -- they've decided, 'this is the place I want to see this event,' and it's because of the spectacular scenery, the amazing natural resources we protect and the relation to our past ... that make national parks a unique place to go to experience this event," Melena said. 

	For example, one of the parks in the path of totality is the Manhattan Project National Historical Park, which commemorates the creation of the atomic bomb used in World War II. 

	"Personally, the connection I would make here would be about science -- about learning and discovery," Melena said. "To learn about atoms and how they work -- that's an aspect of the story that the park has to tell, but in relation to the eclipse, it's about learning and discovery and about understanding the world around us."

	Many of the national parks in the path of totality will host special viewing events or other related programs and activities. If you're planning on making a trip to see the total solar eclipse, here's a list of all of the national parks that will experience the daytime darkness cast by the moon's shadow.
