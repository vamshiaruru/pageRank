Dazzling Lightning Flashes Captured in Solar Eclipse's Shadow

	What does an eclipse's path look like from space? Satellite cameras captured spectacular views of the Great American Solar Eclipse's shadow sweeping across the U.S. from coast to coast, including a sequence showing infrared images of the eclipse path punctuated by flashes of lighting from storms.

	A lightning-tracking instrument called the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) -- attached to a weather satellite operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) -- caught the lightning in action in the upper Midwest region of the U.S. while the eclipse was underway.

	The lightning mapper -- the first instrument of its kind in geostationary orbit -- observes lightning that occurs around the clock within clouds, and between clouds and the ground. It is installed on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-16), which collects images and atmospheric data, and monitors space weather, according to NOAA's mission description.

	By monitoring changes in lightning strength and frequency, GLM and other forecasting tools can help scientists better predict severe storms as they develop, NOAA reported.
