'Levitating' Moon Dust Explained

	A new study may explain how dust particles on the moon "levitate" just above the surface, even though there is no wind or flowing water on the moon to kick-up the material. 

	In a recent laboratory study, researchers found that micron-size dust particles could "jump" several centimeters high under ultraviolet (UV) radiation or exposure to plasmas (electrically charged gas), said a statement from NASA. This finding may help researchers better understand how lunar dust is transported across vast regions of the moon and other airless bodies, according to the statement. 

	"On Earth's moon, these dust particles would have been lofted more than 4 inches (10 centimeters) above the lunar surface, leading researchers to conclude that the moon's 'horizon glow' -- seen in images taken by Surveyor 5, 6 and 7 five decades ago -- may have been caused in part by sunlight scattering in a cloud of electrostatically lofted dust particles," NASA officials said in the statement.
