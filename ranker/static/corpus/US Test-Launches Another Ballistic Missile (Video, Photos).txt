US Test-Launches Another Ballistic Missile (Video, Photos)

	For the second week in a row, the United States Air Force has tested an unarmed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).

	The Minuteman III ICBM was launched from a silo at California's Vandenberg Air Force Base this morning (May 3) at 3:02 a.m. EDT (0702 GMT; 12:02 a.m. local California time), military officials said.

	The Air Force also conducted a test of an unarmed Minuteman III from Vandenberg just after midnight local time last Wednesday (April 26).

	The two tests have come amid relatively high tensions with North Korea, an unpredictable, nuclear-armed nation that has repeatedly stated a desire to destroy the United States and its allies, including South Korea and Japan."The purpose of the ICBM test launch program is to validate and verify the effectiveness, readiness and accuracy of the weapon system, according to Air Force Global Strike Command," Air Force officials wrote Saturday (April 29) in a statement announcing the test launch.
