3D Stellar Map: Neighboring Stars Could Disturb Solar System in Distant Future



	A new time-lapse video of stars neighboring the Milky Way shows that these close-by stars have the potential to cause disturbances to the solar system as they travel over the next hundreds of thousands of years.

	The European Space Agency's (ESA) Gaia telescope is on a five-year mission to catalog a billion stars from space, building a 3D map, and aims to show the true structure of the Milky Way galaxy. Gaia also monitors stellar properties, such as brightness, temperature and physical composition.

	Gaia operates at a position in space known as the Lagrange-2 (L-2) point, where the gravities of Earth and sun balance each other out. Since the telescope is orbiting at a distance far beyond the moon's orbit, Earth's obstruction of the telescope's full night-sky view is minimized. This is an issue sometimes faced by telescopes in low-Earth orbit, like the Hubble Space Telescope. [Photos: Gaia Spacecraft to Map Milky Way Galaxy]

	The new ESA video features the projected movements of over 300,000 stars. The video shows that as these stars travel over time, they could dislodge comets at the far end of the solar system if they  pass within 37 trillion miles (60 trillion kilometers) of the sun. Sixteen stars will come within that distance in the next 5 million years, ESA officials said in a statement.
