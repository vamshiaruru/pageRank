Two outlandish yet similar tales told half a century apart seem to indicate that aliens may at times appear nude. On April 19, 1897, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch printed a letter from one W. H.

As he approached, a similarly clad man stepped up to protect her. Though neither being spoke English, Hopkins convinced them of his peaceful intentions. Asked where they came from, they "pointed upwards, pronouncing a word which sounded like Mars."
On March 28, 1950, Samuel Eaton Thompson reportedly met up with nude Venusian men, women, and children in a forest outside Mineral, Washington.
