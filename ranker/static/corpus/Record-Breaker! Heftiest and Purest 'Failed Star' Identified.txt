Record-Breaker! Heftiest and Purest 'Failed Star' Identified

	An ancient brown dwarf is the most massive and purest such "failed star" ever discovered, a new study suggests.

	Researchers studied an object called SDSS J0104+1535, which lies about 750 light-years from Earth in the Milky Way's "halo," a population of extremely old stars above the galaxy's familiar spiral disk.

	SDSS J0104+1535 is a brown dwarf -- a bizarre, gaseous body larger than a planet but too small to sustain the nuclear fusion reactions that power stars. New observations by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile provide new details about this object, which astronomers think is 10 billion years old.

	For example, study team members said, SDSS J0104+1535 is about 90 times more massive than Jupiter, making it the heaviest known brown dwarf. (For perspective: The sun is 1,050 times more massive than Jupiter. And Jupiter is 318 times more massive than Earth.)

	In addition, just 0.01 percent of SDSS J0104+1535 consists of elements other than hydrogen and helium -- meaning that the body is 250 times purer than the sun, and the purest brown dwarf ever observed.

	"Pure" in this sense refers to the stuff originally present just after the Big Bang that created the universe 13.82 billion years ago -- mostly hydrogen and helium, along with small amounts of lithium. All the naturally occurring elements heavier than these three were created inside stars over the eons.
