How Space Camp Works 
In 1986, the movie "Space Camp" flared the imaginations of kids everywhere. The film featured a bunch of mismatched, teenage geniuses who accidentally ended up in space. When it turned out that space camp wasn't just a product of Hollywood and actually existed, the fascination only got bigger. About 750 students attended Space Camp in Huntsville, Ala., in 1982, the year the movie opened; the summer after it hit theaters, 12,000 signed up.

Dottie Metcalf-Lindenburger is the first -- and so far, only -- Space Camp alumnus to become an astronaut. She attended Space Camp in 1994, at the age of 14. After college, she started teaching high school and astronomy in Washington state and learned NASA was looking for teacher-astronauts. She applied, and in 2004, found herself in the Astronaut Candidate Class of 2004. She's now working in NASA's education division, waiting to be assigned to a mission.
