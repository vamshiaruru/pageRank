Elon Musk's SpaceX Blooper Reel: 'It's Just a Scratch'



	On Aug. 31, Musk announced on Twitter that he was "Putting together a SpaceX rocket-landing blooper reel. We messed up a lot before it finally worked, but there's some epic explosion footage ..."

	Musk delivered on that promise today (Sept. 14), with the debut of a video just over 2 minutes long that's filled with blowups set to the cheerful "Monty Python" theme song. [6 Ways Entrepreneur Elon Musk Is Changing the World]

	The conflagrations really are like no other, and Elon insists that they're "just a scratch" or a "rapid unscheduled disassembly" in some cases.

	Despite the flaming wreckage, the reel has a happy ending. SpaceX celebrated its first successful touchdown on land with its Falcon 9 rocket in December 2015 and its first successful drone-ship landing with a reusable Falcon 9 rocket booster in April 2016.
