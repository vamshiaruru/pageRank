Stunning Photo Shows Total Solar Eclipse's March Across Oregon Sky

	A newly released composite photo of the total solar eclipse shows the entire celestial event as it unfolded over Oregon, revealing different phases of the eclipse as the moon blotted out the sun's light.  

	On Monday (Aug. 21), the moon passed between Earth and the sun, creating a total solar eclipse that was visible along a narrow path that stretched across the contiguous United States, from Oregon to South Carolina.

	It had been 99 years since a total solar eclipse last swept across the contiguous United States. This time around, the so-called path of totality measured about 70 miles (113 kilometers) wide and cut through 14 states, including parts of Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina. Elsewhere in the country, and across the entire North American continent, spectators were treated to a partial eclipse of the sun.

	But the so-called Great American Solar Eclipse wasn't just viewed from the ground. Satellites in orbit, astronauts aboard the International Space Station, high-altitude research balloons and even airplanes caught glimpses of celestial show.
